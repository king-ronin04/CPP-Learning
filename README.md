# C++-Learning
C++ is the most used and most popular programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup. C++ is a high-level and object-oriented programming language. This language 
allows developers to write clean and efficient code for large applications and software development, game development, and operating system programming. It is an 
expansion of the C programming language to include Object Oriented Programming(OOPs) and is used to develop programs for computers.

## C++ Hello World Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Main() function: where the execution of
int main()
{
	cout << "Hello World!";
	return 0;
}

```
## Output
```output
Hello World!
```

**There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.**

- Class
- Objects
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
