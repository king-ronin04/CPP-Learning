# Salary Computation
Danny has recently got his job offer as an Event Concept Creator at Sparsh Event Services. The Company has sent him a detailed salary structure with details of his basic salary, HRA and DA. The Company has promised to pay him as under:

If his basic salary is less than Rs. 15000, then HRA = 15% of basic salary and DA = 90% of basic salary.
<br>
If his basic salary is either equal to or above Rs. 15000, then HRA = Rs. 5000 and DA = 98% of basic salary.
<br>
If the Danny’s salary is given as input, write a program to find his gross salary.
<br>
Note : Gross Salary = Basic Salary+HRA+DA

#### Input format :
First line of the input is an integer that corresponds to the basic salary of Danny.

#### Output format :
Output should display the double value that refers to the gross salary of Danny. Display the output correct to 2 decimal places.

**Sample test cases : <br>

```cpp
#include<iostream>
#include<iomanip>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
		int salary;
		double amount,hra,da;
		cin>>salary;
		if(salary < 15000) {
			hra = 0.15*salary;
			da = 0.90*salary;
			amount = salary+hra+da;
		}
		else {
			da = 0.98*salary;
			amount = salary+5000+da;
		}
	cout<<fixed<<setprecision(2)<<amount;

}
